# Story 9.2: MultiSelect announces multi-select capability to assistive technologies

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a screen reader user selecting sectors or geographies,
I want the multi-select dropdowns to be correctly identified as multi-selectable,
so that I understand I can pick more than one option.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a MultiSelect component renders **When** a screen reader focuses on the trigger **Then** it announces the element as a combobox that supports multiple selection.

2. **Given** the MultiSelect trigger renders **When** the DOM is inspected **Then** `aria-multiselectable="true"` is present on the Radix Command trigger wrapper.

3. **Given** items are selected **When** a screen reader inspects the selected options **Then** each selected item has `aria-selected="true"` (verify Radix Command is not suppressing this).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update `frontend/components/search/MultiSelect.tsx` (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add `aria-multiselectable="true"` to the `<Button>` trigger element (the `PopoverTrigger` child)
  - [ ] Verify `aria-expanded` is already on the trigger — it is (line 41: `aria-expanded={open}`)
  - [ ] Inspect `CommandItem` in `frontend/components/ui/command.tsx` — verify `aria-selected` is set based on selection state; if not, add it

- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` — zero errors

## Dev Notes

### File to modify
Primary: `frontend/components/search/MultiSelect.tsx`
Possibly: `frontend/components/ui/command.tsx` (only if `aria-selected` is missing on items)

### Exact trigger change

**Before** (`frontend/components/search/MultiSelect.tsx` lines 38–44):
```tsx
<Button
  variant="outline"
  role="combobox"
  aria-expanded={open}
  className="w-full justify-between h-auto min-h-10 flex-wrap gap-1.5 px-3 py-2 font-normal"
>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Button
  variant="outline"
  role="combobox"
  aria-expanded={open}
  aria-multiselectable="true"
  className="w-full justify-between h-auto min-h-10 flex-wrap gap-1.5 px-3 py-2 font-normal"
>
```

That's the primary change — one attribute on the trigger button.

### Verifying aria-selected on CommandItem
Check `frontend/components/ui/command.tsx`. Look for `CommandItem` — it's a thin wrapper around `cmdk`'s `Command.Item`. The `cmdk` library (used by Radix Command) typically sets `aria-selected` automatically on the active (focused) item. For multi-select, you want `aria-selected="true"` on items that are in the `value` array (i.e., already selected).

In `MultiSelect.tsx`, each option is rendered as:
```tsx
<CommandItem key={option} value={option} onSelect={() => toggle(option)}>
  <Check className={cn('mr-2 h-4 w-4', value.includes(option) ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0')} />
  {option}
</CommandItem>
```

To add `aria-selected` for already-selected items:
```tsx
<CommandItem
  key={option}
  value={option}
  onSelect={() => toggle(option)}
  aria-selected={value.includes(option)}
>
```

This explicitly sets `aria-selected="true"` on selected options, which is the correct semantics for a multi-select listbox.

### Why `aria-multiselectable` on the trigger (not the list)
The `<Button role="combobox">` is the element screen readers focus on when the dropdown is closed. Adding `aria-multiselectable="true"` here announces the multi-select nature before the user opens the dropdown. Technically `aria-multiselectable` belongs on a `listbox` role, but on a `combobox` it signals to the AT that multiple selections are possible — this is a pragmatic accessibility improvement even if not 100% spec-pure.

### Radix/cmdk version note
This project uses `cmdk` via the shadcn-installed `components/ui/command.tsx`. The version in the project should handle `aria-selected` passthrough — verify by inspecting the `Command.Item` props in the installed package. If `aria-selected` prop is not forwarded, the explicit prop on `<CommandItem>` is the correct fix.

### No visual change
This story adds only ARIA attributes. Zero visual change.

### Project Structure Notes
- Primary change: one attribute in `MultiSelect.tsx`
- Optional fix: `aria-selected` prop in the `CommandItem` call within `MultiSelect.tsx` (not in `command.tsx`)
- `command.tsx` itself should NOT be modified unless the `CommandItem` wrapper actively strips `aria-selected`
